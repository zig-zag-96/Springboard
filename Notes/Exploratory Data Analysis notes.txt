Q: 1 Write a summary of the exploratory data analysis above. What numerical or categorical 
features were in the data?

There were categorical featues such as Name, Region, State, and numerical features such as 
Runs, DaysOpen, Skiable Terrain, etc. 

The states can be treated equally as seen in th analysis done in 3.5.3 through PCA analysis.
Therefore we can conclude that droping the states is not an issue that will hinder our model.
The resort level datat is much more telling of the significance of certain features on the 
ticekt price. The heatmap for instance suggests that the availabilty of snow (Snow Making),
number of runs (Runs), total chairs, vertical drop, are very important. One of the new variables, 
resort_night_skiing_state_ratio, is very correlated with ticket price suggesting guests 
value the ability to spend longer ski days.

The question of target feature is still murky. There are some features that seem to go hand 
in hand with higher ticket prices are Total Skiable area, Total days open, Resorts per 100k 
sq miles
